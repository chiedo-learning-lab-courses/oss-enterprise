# Establish program goals

After completing the self assessment, the next step is to establish a clear set of goals for your open source program.  Use the following matrix to guide the discussion:

| Dimension | Current Level | Goals |
| --------- | ----- | ----- |
| Consuming open source software |      |      |
| Contributing back to the open source projects you consume |      |      |
| Producing your own open source software |      |     |

### Levels within each dimension
