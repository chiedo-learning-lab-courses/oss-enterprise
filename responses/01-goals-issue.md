# Establish program goals

After completing the self assessment, the next step is to establish a clear set of goals for your open source program.  Use the following matrix to guide the discussion:

| Dimension | Current Level | Goals |
| --------- | ----- | ----- |
| Consuming open source software |      |      |
| Contributing back to the open source projects you consume |      |      |
| Producing your own open source software |      |     |

### Levels within each dimension

**Ad-hoc** - a new or undocumented process is uncontrolled, reactive and unpredictable, typically driven by individuals without coordination or communication. Success depends on individual heroics.

**Managed** - a process is partially documented, possibly leading to consistent results. Success depends on discipline.

**Defined** - a process is documented, standardized, and integrated into other processes. Success depends on automation.

**Measured** - the process is quantitatively managed. Success depends on measuring metrics against business goals.

**Optimized** - the process is continually and reliably improving through both incremental and innovative changes. Success depends on reducing the risk of change.

## Step 1: Establish preliminary goals

The goals you set here are preliminary, you'll have an opportunity to formalize them later.
