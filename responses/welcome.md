# Welcome! 

Congratulations on taking the first steps to becoming an open source enterprise! This course will be your companion as you explore and develop the resources necessary to ramp up your teams and transform your organization's culture. Through a series of issues and pull requests, you'll create an open source kit: a repository that will house all resources for an open source program.

Throughout the course, you'll be prompted to have offline conversations with departments, teams, and individuals across your organization. To get the most out of this course, consider pausing as the bot prompts you to have these conversations and returning when you're ready. At the end of this course you'll have a fully functional repository with a trove of templates and guides you can use to kickstart your program.
