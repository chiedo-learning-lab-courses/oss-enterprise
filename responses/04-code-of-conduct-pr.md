## Add a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` to your organization's open source repository

This pull request introduces a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` template file.

This template will be recommended for all of your organization's repositories. Unlike the `CONTRIBUTING.md`, it should **not** be customized by the maintainers.

A user's experience in your open source project will become a reflection of your brand. How will you protect contributors from harassing or belittling behavior? What will you do when someone is behaving inappropriately? Adding a code of conduct to your projects will promote and facilitate healthy behavior within your community.

### Partners in this process

You may want to @ mention the individuals responsible for Diversity, Inclusion and Communication to be your partners in this step.

### Why your project needs a code of conduct

For more information on why a code of conduct is a good idea, check out the article [opensource.guide:  Your Code of Conduct](https://opensource.guide/code-of-conduct/).

### Using an established code of conduct

Thought leaders on establishing healthy behaviors in the open source community have joined forces to develop some fantastic drop-in codes of conduct. GitHub makes it easy to drop these established documents in to any project. To read directions on how to use this drop-in code, check out this [help documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project/).

Here are the drop-in codes currently supported by GitHub:

- [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/)
- [Citizen Code of Conduct](http://citizencodeofconduct.org/)

### Adding a code of conduct to an existing project

If you already have an open source project, it is easy to add a code of conduct:

If you consume or contribute to a project that does not have a code of conduct, you should not be shy about suggesting one to the project maintainers.

### Should you customize the code of conduct?

It is generally acceptable to customize the code of conduct to meet your organization's needs, however we find the examples developed by the open source community are very good and will meet the needs of the majority of organizations. If you are interested in creating your own, check out some of these examples for inspiration:

- [Django Code of Conduct](https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/)
- [Python Community Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/) and [Diversity Statement](https://www.python.org/community/diversity/)
- [Ubuntu Code of Conduct](http://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu/conduct)
- [Geek Feminism Code of Conduct](http://geekfeminism.org/about/code-of-conduct/)
