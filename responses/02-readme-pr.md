## Update the README for your open source kit

This pull request adds a file called `README.md` to this open source kit. This repository is where people will come for help and information when they want to open source projects within your organization. The information in the `README.md` should help give those people what they're looking for.

This `README.md` is _not_ a template for others when open sourcing their projects. Instead, this provides guidelines for when to open source projects and how to do it.

The `README.md` already has some great information. Customize the document with more recommendations for your company and then merge.

It's a good idea to include links to other documents that you've created (or will create in the future). For example, add other links to things like your `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Then, others will know that the templates exist and should be used.
