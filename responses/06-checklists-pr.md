## Step 6: Add checklist to ISSUE_TEMPLATE

**tl;dr** When an individual or team is contemplating releasing a project as open source, there will be a number of steps for them to complete. The first step will be to open an issue in this repository. In this pull request, we will create an ISSUE_TEMPLATE which will contain the tracking checklist for releasing a project as open source and some key questions for them to consider.

### Partners in this process

You may want to @ mention the individuals responsible for legal, compliance, security and marketing to be your partners in this step.

### Using the checklist

**This checklist should be the one-stop-shop for open sourcing repositories in your organization.**

A great open source checklist:
- Is the canonical source of truth for the steps to be taken before open sourcing a project
- Contains appropriate links to enable project maintainers to complete the process with minimal support
- Includes appropriate information on the teams or individuals to mention at each stage of the process
- Demands 100% compliance. All of the boxes should be checked or an issue comment added about why a specific step isn't necessary BEFORE a project is released as open source.

### Activity: Create a checklist for new issues about open sourcing projects
