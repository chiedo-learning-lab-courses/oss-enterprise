## Establish program  goals

After completing the self assessment, the next step is to establish a clear set of goals for your open source program.  Use the following matrix to guide the discussion:

| Dimension | Current Level | Goals |
| --------- | ----- | ----- |
| Consuming open source software |      |      |
| Contributing back to the open source projects you consume |      |      |
| Producing your own open source software |      |     |

### Levels within each dimension

**Ad-hoc** - a new or undocumented process is uncontrolled, reactive and unpredictable, typically driven by individuals without coordination or communication. Success depends on individual heroics.

**Managed** - a process is partially documented, possibly leading to consistent results. Success depends on discipline.

**Defined** - a process is documented, standardized, and integrated into other processes. Success depends on automation.

**Measured** - the process is quantitatively managed. Success depends on measuring metrics against business goals.

**Optimized** - the process is continually and reliably improving through both incremental and innovative changes. Success depends on reducing the risk of change.

The goals you set here are preliminary, you'll have an opportunity to formalize them later. Feel free to jot your goals in this issue, or just type "done" to move on.
